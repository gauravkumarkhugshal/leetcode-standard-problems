Millin Views : ProjectElon : How to Study SMARTER, Not HARDER : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HexCRbWfDM :

How: Bath , Aerobic Exercise, Faith:


1. Advanced Information Processing : 

If you read a book and you get to the end , and you realize you retain nothing. It is because you are not asking questions.
If you are not asking questions and not engaging, then you are wasting your time, With asking more questions you can study smartly.(ask yourself questions regularly and find answers).


2. Space Repetition :

memorize information , a couple of days later reinforce the information, (do questions in mind and check solutions) for example
bitwise_operators_questions.txt and verify solutions.
Active Recall : 

Proper Notes (Screen Shots of Concepts gained from the questions).
Proper Text Files Save in Github.[In the Tabs]
Audio Notes in chrome.
Contemplate ( permutation , subset sum , quick sort )


3.Prato Principle : 20 percent -> 80% ( weekly , 3 - 4 ) : 
Arrays/String Problems specific to company to applying. 
 
4.Feynman technique :
Step 1 : study in depth and make notes
Step 2: teach someone who does not even know basics.
Step 3: simplify and explain the topics. observe which part of topic you are able to explain well go back and recall.
Explain it others in easiest way , if you can explain it in simple language then you understood it very well. 
Youtube Video may be later , providing hints for future reference. ( try to form permutation of 4 digit.)

0. Array/String/Buffer manipulation (These will be used most frequently.)  
1. Permutation Problem 
2. Subset sum problem 
3. Quick sort
4. Insertion sort
5. Merge sort
6. Subarray sum
